# A Dockerized Python Development Environment Template

This repository provides a template for a dockerized Python development environment with VScode and the Dev Containers extension. By default, the template launches a dockerized Python environment and installs add-ins like Quarto and Jupyter. The template is highly customizable with the use of environment variables.

## Scope
This VScode template includes the following features:
- Dev Containers settings (`devcontainers.json` and `Dockerfile` files)
- Python virtual environment settings
- Quarto
- Jupyter 

## General Requirements
To use this template out of the box, you will need on your local machine the following settings:
- VScode
- The Dev Containers extension
- Docker and Docker Desktop (or equivalent)
- Docker Hub account

A step-by-step guide for setting the above prerequisites is available here:

## The Dev Containers Settingsn

The template was created to enable seamless customization and modification of the Python environment with the use of environment variables. That includes the Python version, the virtual environment name, installation libraries, setting environment variables, etc. The template can be used as a baseline for setting a dockerized Python environment or as a baseline for a more customized template using the `devcontainer.json` file:

`.devcontainer.devcontainer.json`
```json
{
    "name": "${localEnv:PROJECT_A_NAME:my_project_name}",
    // "image": "python:3.10",
    "build": {
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
        "args": {
            "ENV_NAME": "${localEnv:PROJECT_A_NAME:my_project_name}",
            "PYTHON_VER": "${localEnv:PYTHON_VER:3.10}",
            "QUARTO_VER": "${localEnv:QUARTO_VER:1.3.450}"
        }
    },
    "customizations": {
        "settings": {
            "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/opt/conda/envs/${localEnv:PROJECT_A_NAME:my_project_name}/bin/python3",
            "python.selectInterpreter": "/opt/conda/envs/${localEnv:PROJECT_A_NAME:my_project_name}/bin/python3"
        },
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                // Documentation Extensions
                "quarto.quarto",
                "purocean.drawio-preview",
                "redhat.vscode-yaml",
                "yzhang.markdown-all-in-one",
                // Docker Supporting Extensions
                "ms-azuretools.vscode-docker",
                "ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers",
                // Python Extensions
                "ms-python.python",
                "ms-toolsai.jupyter",
                // Github Actions
                "github.vscode-github-actions"
            ]
        }
    },
    // Optional, mount local volume:
    // "mounts": [
    //     "source=${localEnv:DATA_FOLDER},target=/home/csv,type=bind,consistency=cache"
    // ],
    "remoteEnv": {
        "MY_VAR": "${localEnv:MY_VAR:test_var}"
    },
    "runArgs": [
        "--env-file",
        ".devcontainer/devcontainer.env"
    ],
    "postCreateCommand": "python3 tests/test1.py"
}
```
 **Note:** The default setting uses the build argument with the Dockerfile and some bash helper files. Alternatively, you can use the image argument to use any other container.

The `devcontainer.json` Key arguments:
- `name` - defines the project name
- `build` - a wrapper for the `docker build` command, will build the container when launching the Dev Container extension.  Alternatively, you can use the `image` argument to load local or external images from Docker Hub.
- `customizations` - enables the modification of the VScode setting for the container and isolates it from the default settings. In this case, using the following two sub-arguments:
    - `settings` - to set the Python extension default interpreter
    - `vscode.extensions` to define the list of extensions to install upon the launch of the container
- `mounts` - optional (commented), enables to mount additional folders from the local file system in addition to the project root folder
- `remoteEnv` - set environment variables for the environment
- `runArgs` - passes arguments to the container during the run time
- `postCreateCommand` - executes commands on the terminal after the launch of the environment
